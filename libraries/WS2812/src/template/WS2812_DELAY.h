/*
 * This calculation determines how many DELAY loop iterations are needed to stretch out a bit's cycle period to at least 1.25uS.
 * It will stretch the low time for a '0' bit, and the high time for a '1' bit.
 * Roughly this calculates how many actual clock cycles are in the 1.25uS full bit period (based on F_CPU),
 *  and then subtracts the 13 clock cycles that are already spent outside the DELAY loop,
 *  and then divides by 4, the number of clock cycles per DELAY loop iteration.
 * It uses larger numbers than would at first seem necessary in order to avoid integer math truncation errors.
